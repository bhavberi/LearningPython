		           Python Fundamentals

In this, you'll be learning about Python's basics.

		            Python Character Set
Character set is a set of valid characters that a language can recognize. Python supports Unicode encoding standard. That means, it has the following character set:

1. Letters                       ->  A-Z, a-z
2. Digits                          -> 0-9
3. Special Characters -> + - * / ** \ () [] {} // = != == '' "" & # (and many more...)
4. Whitespaces            -> Blank space, tabs, carriage return, newline

		            Tokens
The smallest individual unit in a program is called a Token or a Lexical Unit

Python has following tokens:
1. Keywords
2. Identifiers(Names)
3. Literals
4. Operators
5. Puntuations

		            Barebones of a Python Program
Let us talk about the basic structure of a Python program-what all it contain.

1. Expressions: An expression is any legal combination of symbols that represents a value.
Ex:
(i): 15 (expressions that are values only)
(ii): a+5 (complex expressions that produce a value when evaluated)

2. Statement: A statement is a programming instruction that does something i.e., some action takes place.
Ex:
(i): print('Hello')
-The above statement calls print function and prints 'Hello' as output.
(ii): a=15

Note: When a statement executes, it may or may not yield a vallue.

3.Comments: Comments are additional readable information, which can be read by programmer but these are ignored by Python Interpreter. In Python, comments begin with symbol '#' (Pound or hash character) and end with the end of physical line.
Ex:
 a=15 # 15 is assigned to variable 'a'
-The line written after # is a comment.

And there are many more other things which come under topic 'Python Fundamentals'.
